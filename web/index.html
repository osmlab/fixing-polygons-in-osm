<h1>Fixing Polygons in OSM</h1>

<p><b>As of August 2017 this effort has now been finished! Thanks to everybody
who contributed. See some results in
<a href="https://blog.jochentopf.com/2017-08-28-polygon-fixing-effort-concluded.html">this
blog post</a>. I'll keep this website around for the time being.</b></p>

<p>There are many different ways (multi)polygons in OpenStreetMap can be mapped
correctly and there are even more ways in which they can be mapped incorrectly.
Of the over 260 million (multi)polygons in OSM more than 100,000 contained
mapping errors of one kind or another and about 250,000 were tagged <i>old
style</i> (with tags on the outer ways instead of on the relation) making
multipolygon tagging and processing much more complicated and much more
expensive than it needs to be. But this is not only about multipolygon
relations, it is also about polygons created from closed ways. They also can
and do have errors.</p>

<p>We are trying to fix all this and this web site is here to organize this
effort. Since this effort started a huge amount of work has already been done.
We cleaned up all the old-style multipolygons and many of the mapping
errors, but there is more to do.</p>

<p>When we have finished this effort, <b>mapping will be easier</b>, because
there will be only one canonical way of tagging multipolygons. Editors can take
this into account and help mappers in better ways. And it will make <b>using
the data easier and faster</b> because the programs (such as Osm2pgsql and
Osmium) converting OSM data into multipolygons for rendering or other uses can
be simplified. It will also make it easier to detect mapping errors <b>raising
the quality of the OSM data</b>.</p>

<p>There are many ways of helping with this effort depending on your
OSM skill level and time. <a href="fixing.html">Read this</a> to get you
started fixing things.</a></p>

<h2><img src="/img/map-64.png" width="16" height="16"/> <a href="/map/index.html">Old-style multipolygon comparison map</a></h2>

<p><strike>To see what the map would look like if we didn't handle <i>old style</i>
multipolygons specially, but just render everything according to the <i>new
style</i> rules, you can use our <a href="/map/index.html">comparison
map</a>.</strike></p>
<p>The comparison map is not available any more after the old-style
polygons have been cleaned up. You can use the
<a href="http://tools.geofabrik.de/osmi/?view=areas">OSM Inspector</a>
to find remaining old-style multipolygons.</p>
