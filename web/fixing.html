<h1>Getting Started Fixing Polygons in OSM</h1>

<p>There are many ways of helping with this effort depending on your
OSM skill level and time.</p>

<p>The priority for the following jobs is specified according to the visibility
of the problems on the map: The priority "High" is for larger (multi)polygons
such as forests that can possibly affect a large map area. "Low" is used for
problems that are invisible or nearly invisible on usual maps. "Medium" is for
everything in between, such as buildings, etc.</p>

<h2 id="maproulette">Using Maproulette</h2>

<p>We are creating several Maproulette challenges for different
skill levels, regions, and problems. They will be rolled out piece
by piece. We are starting with simpler ones and build up towards
the more complex problems.</p>

<div class="job">
    <h3 id="with-same-tags-forests">Same tags on member way in multipolygon relation (Forests)</h3>

    <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Medium</p>
    <p><b>Priority:</b> High</p>
    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-06-26</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> Quite often some of the outer or inner ways in a
    multipolygon relation have the same tags as the relation itself. This is
    usually wrong and leads to wrong renderings. Note that some tags can be the
    same, say you have a coniferous forest with a deciduous forest in the middle.
    But all tags being the same usually doesn't make sense. (Certain tags such as
    "source" are ignored in this comparison.) A member way should only have the
    tags describing that specific way only, not anything belonging to the whole
    multipolygon.</p>

    <p><b>To fix this:</b> Displayed are ways that are a member of a
    multipolygon relation of a forest and have the same tags as the relation.
    Often you can just remove the tags from the way, but look at the tags of
    the relation and all member ways and figure out what's right. Look at
    satellite images to help guide you.</p>

    <p>The challenge has been split up very roughly by region:</p>

    <ul>
    <li><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/2625">France</a></li>
    <li><strike><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/2627">Germany</a></strike> (<span class="done">&#10004;</span> done)</li>
    <li><strike><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/2626">Italy</a></strike> (<span class="done">&#10004;</span> done)</li>
    <li><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/2624">Rest of the world</a></li>
    </ul>

<h2 id="osm-inspector">Using the OSM Inspector</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://tools.geofabrik.de/osmi/?view=areas">Areas
View</a> in the OSM Inspector show a lot of different information
about broken areas. It is a great tool for the advanced mapper, but
can be daunting for the beginner. Old-style multipolygons do not show
up in this view, because it would be too much data.</p>

<div class="job">
    <h3 id="fixing-duplicate-nodes">Fixing duplicate nodes</h3>

    <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Easy</p>
    <p><b>Priority:</b> Low</p>
    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-02-23</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> One very simple task is to fix duplicate nodes using
    OSMI and JOSM. Duplicate nodes are two nodes at the same position or one
    node that is in a way twice.</p>

    <p><b>To work on this:</b> Go to the OSM Inspector and only
    activate the duplicate nodes layers. Find an area you want to fix
    with lots of orange dots and load it into JOSM (using the edit button
    with the little "J" in it). Activate the validator in JOSM and run it.
    Click on the "Mixed type duplicated nodes" warning and then the "Fix"
    button to fix them.</p>

<div class="job job-done">
    <h3 id="fixing-multipolygons-in-south-korea">Fixing multipolygons in South Korea</h3>

    <p>This is mostly done, South Korea doesn't look worse than other places on
    the planet now.</p>

    <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Medium</p>
    <p><b>Priority:</b> High</p>
    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-03-29</p>
    <p><b>Challenge finished:</b> 2017-05-27</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> South Korea has a lot of broken multipolygons. The
    problems include self-intersections, overlapping areas, and other problems,
    mostly on forest and other landuse polygons. The problems are too dense
    to fix using Maproulette.</p>

    <p><b>To work on this:</b> Go to the OSM Inspector and
    <a href="http://tools.geofabrik.de/osmi/?view=areas&lon=128.14709&lat=36.54848&zoom=8">look at South Korea</a>.
    Choose a random starting point, load the area into JOSM and start fixing
    problems. Upload often to minimize duplicate work.</p>
    <p>You can load the OSM Inspector Area view into JOSM as a background
    layer to simplify this. In JOSM, open the menu "Imagary -&gt; Imagery preferences",
    then find "OSM Inspector: Area" in the "Menu Name" column in the table.
    Click on it and then the "Activate" button below the table and close the
    dialog with "OK". You can now choose "OSM Inspector: Area" from the
    "Imagery" menu whenever you want to add the layer. The layer is transparent,
    so you can use it together with a satellite image layer.</p>

<h2 id="fixing-old-style-multipolygons-with-josm">Fixing old-style multipolygons with JOSM</h2>

<p>Cleanup of all the old old-style multipolygons is done. New ones will
occasionally be created by editors/mappers who don't know yet how to correctly
map multipolygons. So some cleanup might still be necessary now and then.</p>

<p>Fixing old-style multipolygons isn't very difficult with JOSM. Look at this
<a href="old-style-josm.html">step-by-step description</a> which also has
a lot of handy "productivity" tips.</p>
