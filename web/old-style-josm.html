<h1>Fixing old-style multipolygons with JOSM</h1>

<p>Fixing old-style multipolygons isn't very difficult with JOSM. Here
is a step-by-step description on what to do.</p>

<h2>1. Find a suitable area to work on</h2>

<p>First you need an area to work on. You can look at the <a
href="/map/">comparison map</a>, pick out an area with lots of old-style
multipolygons and load it into JOSM using the "JOSM" button on the top
right. (You have to start JOSM before this and have remote control enabled.)</p>

<h2>2. Fix the multipolygons</h2>

<div class="img"><img src="/img/josm-relations-list.png"/><br/>
<i>Old-style multipolygons will show up in the relations list without a
type (like the first three in the image above). New-style multipolygons will
(most of the time) show up with the type in parentheses, like the highlighted
one in the image.</i></div>

<p>Choose a multipolygon in the "Relations" list and select it (Choose "Select
relation" in the context menu). Zoom to the selection (in the "Selection" list,
choose "Zoom to selection" in the context menu). Download the area shown. You
now have the full relation with current data and all its context in JOSM.</p>

<p>Now look at the relation and its members and fix it.</p>

<p>Often you can use JOSM's built-in function "Update multipolygon"
(Ctrl+Shift+B) in the "Tools" menu. This will move tags from the outer way to
the relation. But it will not work with old-style multipolygons with multiple
outer ways. Select the multipolygon and one of its ways first to use this.</p>

<p>If the multipolygon only has a single outer way, you might want to simply
leave the tags on the way and delete the multipolygon relation.</p>

<p>After you have fixed the multipolygon, move on to the next one. If you are
in an area with lots of multipolygons, chances are each time you load the
context of one, more old-style multipolygons will be loaded, too. This way
you can move quickly through an area.</p>

<h2>3. Uploading the changes</h2>

<p>When you are uploading the changes, please use a changeset comment that
contains the words "old-style multipolygon". That way we can track this work
better.</p>

<h2>Tip: Using Overpass to load old-style multipolygons into JOSM</h2>

<div class="img"><img src="/img/overpass-josm.png"/><br/>
<i>"Download from Overpass API" dialog in JOSM.</i></div>

<p>You can also start by using an Overpass queries to find (most) old-style
multipolygons. In JOSM go to the "File" menu and choose "Download from Overpass
API", enter the following query which finds all multipolygon relations without
tags and choose an area.</p>

<p><pre>
relation({{bbox}})
  [type=multipolygon]
  (if:count_tags()==1);
(._;&gt;;);
out meta;
</pre></p>

Or you can use this somewhat more complete query which also finds relations
with some more tags:

<p><pre>
(
  relation["type"="multipolygon"]({{bbox}}) (if:count_tags()==1);
  relation["type"="multipolygon"]["created_by"]({{bbox}}) (if:count_tags()==2);
  relation["type"="multipolygon"]["source"]({{bbox}}) (if:count_tags()==2);
  relation["type"="multipolygon"]["note"]({{bbox}}) (if:count_tags()==2);
);
(._;&gt;;);
out;
</pre></p>

<h2>Tip: Using Filters in JOSM</h2>

<p>A JOSM filter containing</p>

<p><pre>
type:relation type=multipolygon tags:1
</pre></p>

will match all multipolygon relations with only the single tag
<tt>type=multipolygon</tt>, which is most of the old-style multipolygons.</p>

<p>Activate the "Enable filter" and "Invers filter" checkboxes to hide
everything but those multipolygons.</p>

<h2>Tip: Adding overlay from comparison map to JOSM</h2>

<p>The <a href="/map/">comparison map</a> has an overlay showing all old-style
multipolygons. You can easily add this overlay to JOSM:</p>

<p>Go to the "Imagery" menu and choose "Imagery preferences". Next to the
"Selected entries" list, click on the button labelled "+ TMS". Enter</p>
<p><pre>http://area.jochentopf.com/old_mp_ways_overlay/{zoom}/{x}/{y}.png</pre></p>
<p>in the URL field. Set the max zoom level to 18 and enter a name such as
"Old-style multipolygons". Click OK twice to close the dialogs. You should
now have another entry in "Imagery" menu that activates the layer.</p>

<p>The layer is transparent so you can use it over one of the satellite
image layers.</p>


<h2>Caution!</h2>

<p><b>Do not just blindly update everything!</b> Look at the tags on the
relation and on all member ways, look at multipolygons around it, look at the
satellite images, check that the roles are set correctly and use the validator.
Especially with very old data, there is often a chance to update some tags,
too. Or there might be geometrical problems, or the data might be from an old
import and is just outdated. As always with editing OSM data: Take care to do
the right thing and use your judgement.</p>
