<h1>Getting Started Fixing Polygons in OSM</h1>

<p>There are many ways of helping with this effort depending on your
OSM skill level and time.</p>

<p>The priority for the following jobs is specified according to the visibility
of the problems on the map: The priority "High" is for larger (multi)polygons
such as forests that can possibly affect a large map area. "Low" is used for
problems that are invisible or nearly invisible on usual maps. "Medium" is for
everything in between, such as buildings, etc.</p>

<h2 id="maproulette">Using Maproulette</h2>

<p>We are creating several Maproulette challenges for different
skill levels, regions, and problems. They will be rolled out piece
by piece. We are starting with simpler ones and build up towards
the more complex problems.</p>

<div class="job">
    <h3 id="inner-with-same-tags">Inner ways with same tags as multipolygon relation</h3>

    <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Medium</p>
    <p><b>Priority:</b> Medium</p>
    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-05-13</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> The inner ways in a multipolygon relation must
    have different tags than the relation. If they have the same tag, why
    are they there at all? This is often a remnant of very old tagging, or
    it simply can be an error.</p>

    <p><b>To fix this:</b> The line shows a multipolygon relation member way
    that has the same tags as its relation. Look at the tags on the relation
    and *all* members and make sure they make sense. Outer and inner ways
    should either have no tags at all or tags only pertaining to those ways.
    The relation should only have tags pertaining to the whole multipolygon.
    You also have to look at the other data in the area, sometimes the problem
    is duplication of data.</p>

    <p>The challenge has been split up very roughly by region. Italy and
    the Netherlands have a huge amount of those issues, so they get their
    own challenge:</p>

    <ul>
    <li><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/2524">Africa</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/2525">Americas</a></li>
    <li><strike><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/2526">Asia + Australia</a></strike> (<span class="done">&#10004;</span> done)</li>

<h2 id="osm-inspector">Using the OSM Inspector</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://tools.geofabrik.de/osmi/?view=areas">Areas
View</a> in the OSM Inspector show a lot of different information
about broken areas. It is a great tool for the advanced mapper, but
can be daunting for the beginner. Old-style multipolygons do not show
up in this view, because it would be too much data.</p>

<div class="job">
    <h3 id="fixing-multipolygons-in-south-korea">Fixing multipolygons in South Korea</h3>

    <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Medium</p>
    <p><b>Priority:</b> High</p>
    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-03-29</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> South Korea has a lot of broken multipolygons. The
    problems include self-intersections, overlapping areas, and other problems,
    mostly on forest and other landuse polygons. The problems are too dense
    to fix using Maproulette.</p>

    <p><b>To work on this:</b> Go to the OSM Inspector and
    <a href="http://tools.geofabrik.de/osmi/?view=areas&lon=128.14709&lat=36.54848&zoom=8">look at South Korea</a>.
    Choose a random starting point, load the area into JOSM and start fixing
    problems. Upload often to minimize duplicate work.</p>
    <p>You can load the OSM Inspector Area view into JOSM as a background
    layer to simplify this. In JOSM, open the menu "Imagary -&gt; Imagery preferences",
    then find "OSM Inspector: Area" in the "Menu Name" column in the table.
    Click on it and then the "Activate" button below the table and close the
    dialog with "OK". You can now choose "OSM Inspector: Area" from the
    "Imagery" menu whenever you want to add the layer. The layer is transparent,
    so you can use it together with a satellite image layer.</p>

    <h3 id="fixing-duplicate-nodes">Fixing duplicate nodes</h3>

    <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Easy</p>
    <p><b>Priority:</b> Low</p>
    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-02-23</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> One very simple task is to fix duplicate nodes using
    OSMI and JOSM. Duplicate nodes are two nodes at the same position or one
    node that is in a way twice.</p>

    <p><b>To work on this:</b> Go to the OSM Inspector and only
    activate the duplicate nodes layers. Find an area you want to fix
    with lots of orange dots and load it into JOSM (using the edit button
    with the little "J" in it). Activate the validator in JOSM and run it.
    Click on the "Mixed type duplicated nodes" warning and then the "Fix"
    button to fix them.</p>

<h2 id="fixing-old-style-multipolygons-with-josm">Fixing old-style multipolygons with JOSM</h2>

<p>Cleanup of all the old old-style multipolygons is done. New ones will
occasionally be created by editors/mappers who don't know yet how to correctly
map multipolygons. So some cleanup might still be necessary now and then.</p>

<p>Fixing old-style multipolygons isn't very difficult with JOSM. Look at this
<a href="old-style-josm.html">step-by-step description</a> which also has
a lot of handy "productivity" tips.</p>
