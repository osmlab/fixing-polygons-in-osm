<h1>Getting Started Fixing Polygons in OSM</h1>

<p>There are many ways of helping with this effort depending on your
OSM skill level and time.</p>

<p>The priority for the following jobs is specified according to the visibility
of the problems on the map: The priority "High" is for larger (multi)polygons
such as forests that can possibly affect a large map area. "Low" is used for
problems that are invisible or nearly invisible on usual maps. "Medium" is for
everything in between, such as buildings, etc.</p>

<h2 id="maproulette">Using Maproulette</h2>

<p>We are creating several Maproulette challenges for different
skill levels, regions, and problems. They will be rolled out piece
by piece. We are starting with simpler ones and build up towards
the more complex problems.</p>

<div class="job">
    <h3 id="duplicate-segments-in-closed-ways">Duplicate segments in closed ways</h3>

    <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Normal</p>
    <p><b>Priority:</b> Medium</p>
    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-03-18</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> There are many cases of <i>duplicate segments</i> where a closed way doubles back on itself. Usually they are left over from way back before we had multipolygons or they are from mappers who don't know about multipolygon relations and are creating several outer or inner rings by "connecting" those rings with parts of a way. There are two common cases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Two or more outer rings connected</li>
        <li>Outer and inner rings connected</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Other cases than this are possible, too.</p>

    <p>Here is an illustration of the first case, where outer rings connect to other outer rings. This is either fixed by having separate closed ways (if the ways can stand by themselves, for instance if they are just forest polygons), or by creating a proper multipolygon relation (if the ways can't stand by themselves, for instance when they form two parts of an area with a common name). You have to look at the tags to decide which case you have.</p>

    <p>And here is an illustration of the second case, where outer rings connect to inner rings. This is usually fixed by creating a proper multipolygon relation.</p>
    <img src="/img/fake-inner.png"/>

    <p><b>To fix this:</b> The segment(s) connecting two different rings of a multipolygon are shown. Remove the connecting segment(s) and create a proper multipolygon or separate (closed way) polygons. In JOSM "Tools/Join overlapping Areas" and "Tools/Create multipolygon" can often be used to do this quickly.</p>

    <p>The challenge has been split up very roughly by region:</p>

    <ul>
    <li><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/2414">Africa</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/2415">Asia + Australia</a></li>
    <li><strike><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/2416">Europe</a></strike> (<span class="done">&#10004;</span> done)</li>
    <li><strike><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/2417">North America</a></strike> (<span class="done">&#10004;</span> done)</li>
    <li><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/2419">South America</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/2420">Korea</a></li>
    </ul>

<h2 id="osm-inspector">Using the OSM Inspector</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://tools.geofabrik.de/osmi/?view=areas">Areas
View</a> in the OSM Inspector show a lot of different information
about broken areas. It is a great tool for the advanced mapper, but
can be daunting for the beginner. Old-style multipolygons do not show
up in this view, because it would be too much data.</p>

<div class="job">
    <h3 id="fixing-duplicate-nodes">Fixing duplicate nodes</h3>

    <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Easy</p>
    <p><b>Priority:</b> Low</p>
    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-02-23</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> One very simple task is to fix duplicate nodes using
    OSMI and JOSM. Duplicate nodes are two nodes at the same position or one
    node that is in a way twice.</p>

    <p><b>To fix this:</b> Go to the OSM Inspector and only
    activate the duplicate nodes layers. Find an area you want to fix
    with lots of orange dots and load it into JOSM (using the edit button
    with the little "J" in it). Activate the validator in JOSM and run it.
    Click on the "Mixed type duplicated nodes" warning and then the "Fix"
    button to fix them.</p>

<h2 id="fixing-old-style-multipolygons-with-josm">Fixing old-style multipolygons with JOSM</h2>

<p>We are currently focusing more on fixing geometrically invalid
(multi)polygons, but if you want to get started on fixing the old-style
multipolygons, that's great, too.</p>

<p>Fixing old-style multipolygons isn't very difficult with JOSM. Look at this
<a href="old-style-josm.html">step-by-step description</a> which also has
a lot of handy "productivity" tips.</p>
