<h1>Getting Started Fixing Polygons in OSM</h1>

<p>There are many ways of helping with this effort depending on your
OSM skill level and time.</p>

<p>The priority for the following jobs is specified according to the visibility
of the problems on the map: The priority "High" is for larger (multi)polygons
such as forests that can possibly affect a large map area. "Low" is used for
problems that are invisible or nearly invisible on usual maps. "Medium" is for
everything in between, such as buildings, etc.</p>

<h2 id="maproulette">Using Maproulette</h2>

<p>We are creating several Maproulette challenges for different
skill levels, regions, and problems. They will be rolled out piece
by piece. We are starting with simpler ones and build up towards
the more complex problems.</p>

<div class="job">
    <h3 id="open-rings">Open Rings</h3>

    <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Normal</p>
    <p><b>Priority:</b> Medium</p>
    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-02-21</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> Multipolygon relations containing an unclosed
    ring. So the boundary of the (multi)polygon is not closed. These can
    not be rendered and must be fixed. Only relations with less than 100
    nodes are show and only if the distance between the open ends is small.</p>

    <p><b>To fix this:</b> Lines show the ring with the markers at the open ends.
    Look at the aerial images first and determine
    whether the multipolygon makes sense. Often it can be removed, because
    there is another (complete) polygon or multipolygon that already does its
    job. If it can be removed, make sure to remove the multipolygon relation
    as well as all the member ways that are not needed for something else.
    If it needs to be kept, close the ring by drawing a new way over
    the the gap or extend an existing way. Some of these need local
    knowledge to fix.</p>

<div class="job">
    <h3 id="wrong-role-inner">Wrong role (should be inner)</h3>

    <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Normal</p>
    <p><b>Priority:</b> Low</p>
    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-02-24</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> Ways that are in a multipolygon relation with the
    wrong role. Only roles 'inner' and 'outer' are allowed and these ways
    should have role 'inner'.</p>

    <p><b>To fix this:</b> This is a way that is in a multipolygon relation and
    the computer thinks it should have the role 'inner'. Verify that this is
    correct and set the right role. False-positives are possible. Sometimes the
    role contains some useful information that can be moved into a tag. Ways
    are often in multiple relations, make sure you fix the right one!</p>

<div class="job job-done">
    <h3 id="self-intersecting-building-outlines">Self-Intersecting Building Outlines (<span class="done">&#10004;</span> job is done)</h3>

    <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Easy</p>
    <p><b>Priority:</b> Medium</p>
    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-02-14</p>
    <p><b>Challenge finished:</b> 2017-02-23</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> Building outlines made from a single way that
    intersects itself. Self-intersection creates invalid polygons that should be
    fixed. Sometimes these are not rendered. Only ways with less than 100 nodes
    show up.</p>

    <p><b>To fix this:</b> Remove the self-intersection. Use the aerial images to
    verify that there is a building. Often the intersection is due to a
    node near (or directly on top of) another node at one of the corners
    and you can simply merge those nodes.</p>

    <p>The challenge has been split up very roughly by region:</p>

<div class="job job-done">
    <h3 id="self-intersecting-landuse-outlines">Self-Intersecting Landuse Outlines (<span class="done">&#10004;</span> job is done)</h3>

    <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Easy</p>
    <p><b>Priority:</b> High</p>
    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-02-21</p>
    <p><b>Challenge finished:</b> 2017-02-26</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> Landuse outlines made from a single way that
    intersects itself. Self-intersection creates invalid polygons that should be
    fixed. Sometimes these are not rendered. Only ways with less than 50 nodes
    show up.</p>

    <p><b>To fix this:</b> Remove the self-intersection. Use the aerial images to
    verify that the landuse is correctly tagged. Often the intersection is due to a
    node near (or directly on top of) another node at one of the corners
    and you can simply remove one of the nodes or merge the nodes.</p>

<h2 id="osm-inspector">Using the OSM Inspector</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://tools.geofabrik.de/osmi/?view=areas">Areas
View</a> in the OSM Inspector show a lot of different information
about broken areas. It is a great tool for the advanced mapper, but
can be daunting for the beginner. Old-style multipolygons do not show
up in this view, because it would be too much data.</p>

<div class="job">
    <h3 id="fixing-duplicate-nodes">Fixing duplicate nodes</h3>

    <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Easy</p>
    <p><b>Priority:</b> Low</p>
    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-02-23</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> One very simple task is to fix duplicate nodes using
    OSMI and JOSM. Duplicate nodes are two nodes at the same position or one
    node that is in a way twice.</p>

    <p><b>To fix this:</b> Go to the OSM Inspector and only
    activate the duplicate nodes layers. Find an area you want to fix
    with lots of orange dots and load it into JOSM (using the edit button
    with the little "J" in it). Activate the validator in JOSM and run it.
    Click on the "Mixed type duplicated nodes" warning and then the "Fix"
    button to fix them.</p>
