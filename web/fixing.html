        <h1>Getting Started Fixing Polygons in OSM</h1>

        <p>There are many ways of helping with this effort depending on your
        skill level and experience with OSM.</p>

        <h2>Maproulette</h2>

        <p>We are creating several Maproulette challenges for different
        skill levels, regions, and problems. They will be rolled out piece
        by piece. We are starting with simpler ones and build up towards
        the more complex problems.</p>

        <h2>Self-Intersecting Building Outlines</h2>

        <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Easy</p>
        <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-02-14</p>

        <p><b>Description:</b> Building outlines made from a single way that
        intersects itself. Self-intersection creates invalid polygons that should be
        fixed. Sometimes these are not rendered. Only ways with less than 100 nodes
        show up.</p>

        <p><b>To fix this:</b> Remove the self-intersection. Use the aerial images to
        verify that there is a building. Often the intersection is due to a
        node near (or directly on top of) another node at one of the corners
        and you can simply merge those nodes.</p>

        <p>The challenge has been split up very roughly by region:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/1478">Africa</a></li>
            <li><strike><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/1479">Asia</a></strike> (done)</li>
            <li><strike><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/1480">Australia</a></strike> (done)</li>
            <li><strike><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/1481">Europe</a></strike> (done)</li>
            <li><strike><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/1482">India</a></strike> (done)</li>
            <li><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/1483">North America</a></li>
            <li><strike><a href="http://maproulette.org/map/1484">South America</a></strike> (done)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Self-Intersecting Landuse Outlines</h2>

        <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Easy</p>
        <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-02-21</p>

        <p><b>Description:</b> Landuse outlines made from a single way that
        intersects itself. Self-intersection creates invalid polygons that should be
        fixed. Sometimes these are not rendered. Only ways with less than 50 nodes
        show up.</p>

        <p><b>To fix this:</b> Remove the self-intersection. Use the aerial images to
        verify that the landuse is correctly tagged. Often the intersection is due to a
        node near (or directly on top of) another node at one of the corners
        and you can simply remove one of the nodes or merge the nodes.</p>

        <h2>Open Rings</h2>

        <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Normal</p>
        <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-02-21</p>

        <p><b>Description:</b> Multipolygon relations containing an unclosed
        ring. So the boundary of the (multi)polygon is not closed. These can
        not be rendered and must be fixed. Only relations with less than 100
        nodes are show and only if the distance between the open ends is small.</p>

        <p><b>To fix this:</b> Lines show the ring with the markers at the open ends.
        Look at the aerial images first and determine
        whether the multipolygon makes sense. Often it can be removed, because
        there is another (complete) polygon or multipolygon that already does its
        job. If it can be removed, make sure to remove the multipolygon relation
        as well as all the member ways that are not needed for something else.
        If it needs to be kept, close the ring by drawing a new way over
        the the gap or extend an existing way. Some of these need local
        knowledge to fix.</p>

        <h2>OSM Inspector</h2>

        <p>The <a href="http://tools.geofabrik.de/osmi/?view=areas">Areas
        View</a> in the OSM Inspector show a lot of different information
        about broken areas. It is a great tool for the advanced mapper, but
        can be daunting for the beginner. Old-style multipolygons do not show
        up in this view, because it would be too much data.</p>
