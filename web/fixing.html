<h1>Getting Started Fixing Polygons in OSM</h1>

<p>There are many ways of helping with this effort depending on your
OSM skill level and time.</p>

<p>The priority for the following jobs is specified according to the visibility
of the problems on the map: The priority "High" is for larger (multi)polygons
such as forests that can possibly affect a large map area. "Low" is used for
problems that are invisible or nearly invisible on usual maps. "Medium" is for
everything in between, such as buildings, etc.</p>

<h2 id="maproulette">Using Maproulette</h2>

<p>We are creating several Maproulette challenges for different
skill levels, regions, and problems. They will be rolled out piece
by piece. We are starting with simpler ones and build up towards
the more complex problems.</p>

<div class="job">
    <h3 id="open-rings">Open Rings</h3>

    <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Normal</p>
    <p><b>Priority:</b> Medium</p>
    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-03-29</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> Multipolygon relations containing an unclosed
    ring. So the boundary of the (multi)polygon is not closed. These can
    not be rendered and must be fixed. Careful, many of these are small, but
    some of them are huge!</p>

    <p><b>To work on this:</b> Lines show the ring with the markers at the open
    ends. Look at the aerial images first and determine whether the
    multipolygon makes sense. Often it can be removed, because there is another
    (complete) polygon or multipolygon that already does its job. If it can be
    removed, make sure to remove the multipolygon relation as well as all the
    member ways that are not needed for something else. If it needs to be kept,
    close the ring by drawing a new way over the gap or extend an existing way.
    Some of these need local knowledge to fix. Do not spend too much time on
    these tasks, if it looks to hard, just mark it as "Too hard to fix".</p>

    <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Easy</p>
    <p><b>Priority:</b> High</p>
    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-04-18</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> Multipolygon relations can not contain the same
    way more than once. The relations in this challenge do.</p>

    <p><b>To work on this:</b> The line(s) shows ways that are multiple times
    in a multipolygon relation. This is always wrong. Load into JOSM, open
    the relation in the relations editor and remove one instance of the way.
    Check for other problems with the relation.</p>

<h2 id="osm-inspector">Using the OSM Inspector</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://tools.geofabrik.de/osmi/?view=areas">Areas
View</a> in the OSM Inspector show a lot of different information
about broken areas. It is a great tool for the advanced mapper, but
can be daunting for the beginner. Old-style multipolygons do not show
up in this view, because it would be too much data.</p>

<div class="job">
    <h3 id="fixing-multipolygons-in-south-korea">Fixing multipolygons in South Korea</h3>

    <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Medium</p>
    <p><b>Priority:</b> High</p>
    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-03-29</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> South Korea has a lot of broken multipolygons. The
    problems include self-intersections, overlapping areas, and other problems,
    mostly on forest and other landuse polygons. The problems are too dense
    to fix using Maproulette.</p>

    <p><b>To work on this:</b> Go to the OSM Inspector and
    <a href="http://tools.geofabrik.de/osmi/?view=areas&lon=128.14709&lat=36.54848&zoom=8">look at South Korea</a>.
    Choose a random starting point, load the area into JOSM and start fixing
    problems. Upload often to minimize duplicate work.</p>
    <p>You can load the OSM Inspector Area view into JOSM as a background
    layer to simplify this. In JOSM, open the menu "Imagary -&gt; Imagery preferences",
    then find "OSM Inspector: Area" in the "Menu Name" column in the table.
    Click on it and then the "Activate" button below the table and close the
    dialog with "OK". You can now choose "OSM Inspector: Area" from the
    "Imagery" menu whenever you want to add the layer. The layer is transparent,
    so you can use it together with a satellite image layer.</p>

<div class="job">
    <h3 id="fixing-duplicate-nodes">Fixing duplicate nodes</h3>

    <p><b>Difficulty level:</b> Easy</p>
    <p><b>Priority:</b> Low</p>
    <p><b>Challenge started:</b> 2017-02-23</p>

    <p><b>Description:</b> One very simple task is to fix duplicate nodes using
    OSMI and JOSM. Duplicate nodes are two nodes at the same position or one
    node that is in a way twice.</p>

    <p><b>To work on this:</b> Go to the OSM Inspector and only
    activate the duplicate nodes layers. Find an area you want to fix
    with lots of orange dots and load it into JOSM (using the edit button
    with the little "J" in it). Activate the validator in JOSM and run it.
    Click on the "Mixed type duplicated nodes" warning and then the "Fix"
    button to fix them.</p>

<h2 id="fixing-old-style-multipolygons-with-josm">Fixing old-style multipolygons with JOSM</h2>

<p>We are currently focusing more on fixing geometrically invalid
(multi)polygons, but if you want to get started on fixing the old-style
multipolygons, that's great, too.</p>

<p>Fixing old-style multipolygons isn't very difficult with JOSM. Look at this
<a href="old-style-josm.html">step-by-step description</a> which also has
a lot of handy "productivity" tips.</p>
